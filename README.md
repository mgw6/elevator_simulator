# Elevator Simulator

This program was as homework assignment for Data Structures an Algorithms (CSE 214) at Stony Brook University. Written in July 2020.

The Elevator simulator program simulates an elevator sytem in a building. To use this program, compile and run the 
Analyzer.java file. When the user starts the program they are asked to input:
- The probability of a request occuring each time step
- How many floors the building has
- The number of elevators in the building
- How many time steps the simulation will take place over. 

The user is then given:
- The total wait time after all riders requested an elevator
- The number of requests completed
- The average wait time after a rider requested an elevator.
